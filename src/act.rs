//! Acting, recorded — and checked against what is already believed.
//!
//! ## The gap this closes
//!
//! The survey in `computer-remake-research/` found that acting and remembering
//! are never the same system. Systems that **act** (open-interpreter, ragfs
//! `.ops/`) accumulate no belief; systems that **remember** (recall,
//! localsearch, ActivityWatch) cannot act. ragfs comes closest — it acts through
//! `.ops/` and audits through `.safety/` — but its memory is an index, not a
//! state of belief.
//!
//! The consequence, stated in `gaps.md` as Gap 8:
//!
//! > **No system in the survey can notice that an action it took contradicted
//! > something it already held.**
//!
//! That is the specific failure the brief calls *catching agentic mistakes*, and
//! it requires action and belief to live in one substrate.
//!
//! ## What this does, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! It is **not** a sandbox and not a permission system. `sh -c` already runs
//! commands; the contribution here is that running one:
//!
//! 1. records the intent as an observation *before* the command runs, so an
//!    action that hangs or kills the process is still in the record;
//! 2. records the outcome with its real duration;
//! 3. **recalls what is already believed about this** and puts it in front of
//!    the operator — especially claims already `Contradicted`, which is the
//!    machine saying *you established this does not work*.
//!
//! Step 3 is the whole point. Steps 1 and 2 are bookkeeping that make it
//! possible.
//!
//! ## Honest limits
//!
//! Relevance is cosine over the command text against claim statements. That is
//! a weak matcher and it is the same lexical-versus-semantic caveat as
//! everywhere else in this crate: under the random-projection fallback it
//! matches strings, not meaning. It surfaces candidates for a person to read; it
//! does not decide anything, and it will miss a contradiction phrased
//! differently from the command that triggers it.
//!
//! **How weak, measured.** The recall of this function has now been measured
//! directly — `act_recall.rs`, `physis-core act-recall`, artifact in
//! `benchmarks/results/act-recall.json`. Eight commands against a 48-claim
//! ledger of one age, each with exactly one claim that refutes it, scored
//! against two construction-matched nulls (k random claims; k random
//! *contradicted* claims):
//!
//! | embedder | arm | recall@5 | MRR@5 |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | bge-base-en-v1.5 | command shares the claim's words | 1.000 | 1.000 |
//! | bge-base-en-v1.5 | command paraphrases it | 0.875 | 0.583 |
//! | random-projection | command shares the claim's words | 0.750 | 0.667 |
//! | random-projection | command paraphrases it | **0.000** | 0.000 |
//!
//! So the limit stated above is real but it is **a property of the embedder,
//! not of this function**. On a semantic embedder the paraphrase case is found
//! seven times in eight and the cost is rank, not presence: the warning arrives
//! mid-list (MRR 0.583) rather than first, and at `--top 1` recall falls to
//! 0.375. On the random-projection fallback — the supported offline mode — the
//! paraphrase case is found *never*, and scores below both nulls.
//!
//! The earlier reading here, taken from the 2×2 of 2026-09-13
//! (`docs/plans/2026-09-13-2x2-first-run.md`, 0–1/7 against a ceiling of 5/7),
//! said this function does not find the contradiction it exists to surface in
//! the normal case. That does not survive the direct measurement and is
//! withdrawn: the 2×2 scored a different task on a different corpus.
//!
//! **The polarity result, which is worse than the recall result.** A second
//! ledger adds every target's *affirmed twin* — same subject, same words,
//! opposite verdict — and asks which of the pair ranks first. No topic
//! separates them, so the null is 0.500 by construction:
//!
//! | embedder | arm | refutation ranked first | reassured at `--top 1` |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | bge-base-en-v1.5 | shares the claim's words | **0.250** | 5 of 8 |
//! | bge-base-en-v1.5 | paraphrase | **0.125** | 3 of 8 |
//! | random-projection | shares the claim's words | 0.750 | 0 of 8 |
//! | random-projection | paraphrase | 0.125 | 0 of 8 |
//!
//! On the semantic embedder this is not a coin flip, it is **inverted**: the
//! endorsement outranks the refutation in six of eight pairs, and in seven of
//! eight when the command is paraphrased. `is_warning` reads `status`, so the
//! wrong one is surfaced wearing `Supported` — a reassurance about the exact
//! thing a `Contradicted` claim refutes.
//!
//! At `--top 5` the list rescues it: both claims are shown in almost every
//! pair, and a person reading five lines sees the refutation. At `--top 1` it
//! does not: in five of eight lexical pairs the only claim printed is the
//! endorsement. **That is the argument for the default being a list.** Do not
//! lower `--top` to 1 on the assumption that the best match is the right one.
//!
//! The random-projection column inverts the ordering of the whole table and is
//! the reason it is printed: the lexical hash keys on `fails`, `never` and `no`
//! — the tokens the semantic space smooths away — so it reads the verdict
//! better and the topic far worse (paraphrase recall 0.000). Neither embedder
//! dominates, and the hybrid that would is untested. Eight pairs, so 0.750 is
//! two pairs above chance and should not be leaned on; the semantic inversion
//! is the robust half, same sign on both arms at every `top`.
//!
//! The structural point stands and is unaffected by the number: `RESCOPE.md` §0
//! settles that the context compiler is the *commodity* half and the ledger is
//! the differentiator — and this, the sharpest thing the ledger does, reaches
//! its data through the compiler. Recorded as conceptual problem 1 in
//! `docs/plans/2026-09-13-four-conceptual-problems.md`. What the measurement
//! adds is which half of the dependency is load-bearing: **offline, Gap 8 is
//! open.**
