//! Acting, recorded — and checked against what is already believed.
//!
//! ## The gap this closes
//!
//! The survey in `computer-remake-research/` found that acting and remembering
//! are never the same system. Systems that **act** (open-interpreter, ragfs
//! `.ops/`) accumulate no belief; systems that **remember** (recall,
//! localsearch, ActivityWatch) cannot act. ragfs comes closest — it acts through
//! `.ops/` and audits through `.safety/` — but its memory is an index, not a
//! state of belief.
//!
//! The consequence, stated in `gaps.md` as Gap 8:
//!
//! > **No system in the survey can notice that an action it took contradicted
//! > something it already held.**
//!
//! That is the specific failure the brief calls *catching agentic mistakes*, and
//! it requires action and belief to live in one substrate.
//!
//! ## What this does, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! It is **not** a sandbox and not a permission system. `sh -c` already runs
//! commands; the contribution here is that running one:
//!
//! 1. records the intent as an observation *before* the command runs, so an
//!    action that hangs or kills the process is still in the record;
//! 2. records the outcome with its real duration;
//! 3. **recalls what is already believed about this** and puts it in front of
//!    the operator — especially claims already `Contradicted`, which is the
//!    machine saying *you established this does not work*.
//!
//! Step 3 is the whole point. Steps 1 and 2 are bookkeeping that make it
//! possible.
//!
//! ## Honest limits
//!
//! Relevance is cosine over the command text against claim statements. That is
//! a weak matcher and it is the same lexical-versus-semantic caveat as
//! everywhere else in this crate: under the random-projection fallback it
//! matches strings, not meaning. It surfaces candidates for a person to read; it
//! does not decide anything, and it will miss a contradiction phrased
//! differently from the command that triggers it.
//!
//! **How weak, measured.** The 2×2 of 2026-09-13
//! (`docs/plans/2026-09-13-2x2-first-run.md`) scored this retrieval family at
//! 0–1/7 against a whole-file ceiling of 5/7. So in the normal case this
//! function does not find the contradiction it exists to surface, and the gap
//! it closes is closed in architecture rather than in practice.
//!
//! That is a structural dependency and not only a quality problem: `RESCOPE.md`
//! §0 settles that the context compiler is the *commodity* half and the ledger
//! is the differentiator — and this, the sharpest thing the ledger does,
//! reaches its data through the compiler. Recorded as conceptual problem 1 in
//! `docs/plans/2026-09-13-four-conceptual-problems.md`.
//!
//! The recall of this function has never been measured directly. It should be,
//! and a construction-matched null is available: surface k random claims of the
//! same age and compare.
