//! Temporal dream — retrospective proposals over the time machine.
//!
//! The time machine (G3) replays the past; the dream pass asks what the
//! past would change *now*. Retired branches were retained, never deleted
//! (G7 invalidate-don't-delete), so they can be **re-proposed**:
//!
//! - a superseded/failed/inert hypothesis whose pattern re-presents itself
//!   in later observations → [`ProposalKind::ReactivateHypothesis`];
//! - a severed DependsOn connection whose target has since re-confirmed →
//!   [`ProposalKind::RestoreConnection`];
//! - a connection whose target keeps contradicting →
//!   [`ProposalKind::RetireConnection`].
//!
//! Dreams are **proposals only**. A dream takes the trail by shared
//! reference and cannot mutate it; every [`RetrospectiveProposal`] cites
//! the historical event/mutation ids that motivated it; nothing applies
//! without an explicit commit by the caller. Many things already happened,
//! and may re-present themselves — the dream is how the past speaks.
