//! Notebook — grounded answers over a local corpus, with citations.
//!
//! The "NotebookLM shape": point it at documents, ask a question, get an answer
//! that is *about those documents* and says which ones it used.
//!
//! ## The split this module insists on
//!
//! Answering from a corpus is two jobs, and conflating them is why systems like
//! this get judged on the wrong axis:
//!
//! - **Selection** — which few hundred tokens of the corpus bear on the
//!   question. This is physis: [`crate::rag`] packs under a hard budget,
//!   [`crate::map`] supplies the structural read.
//! - **Synthesis** — turning that into prose. This is a language model, and
//!   physis does not pretend to be one.
//!
//! So there are two tiers, and the output always says which one produced it:
//!
//! | tier | generator | needs | honest description |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `Extractive` | [`crate::model_provider::NgramDecoderModel`] | nothing | stitches corpus fragments; grounded by construction, not fluent, and not synthesis |
//! | `Synthesised` | any OpenAI-compatible endpoint ([`crate::oracle`]) | `PHYSIS_ORACLE_*` | real prose; a local ollama works and keeps everything offline |
//!
//! A tierless answer would let a fragment-stitcher be mistaken for synthesis,
//! which is the same failure shape as a benchmark that cannot fail.
//!
//! ## Citations are indices, not guesses
//!
//! [`crate::rag::RetrievedChunk::id`] indexes the corpus slice it came from, so
//! a citation is a lookup rather than an inference. The model is asked to cite,
//! but [`Answer::sources`] is filled from the retrieval regardless of what the
//! model says — a model that cites nothing still gets a correct source list,
//! and a model that invents a citation cannot add one.
