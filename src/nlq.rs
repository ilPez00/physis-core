//! Natural-language front door to the world layer — and the measurement that
//! says a cue parser is not enough to be one.
//!
//! ## The gap this addresses
//!
//! `physis-world` answers `locate`, `neighbors`, `history`, `changed`,
//! `compare`, `trace`, `why` and `retrieve`, and every answer prints the chain
//! it came from. But the caller has to already know which verb their question
//! is. That is the one place in this substrate where a person still has to
//! think in the schema.
//!
//! This module maps a sentence onto one of those verbs and a term. It does
//! **not** answer the question and it does not run anything. It returns a
//! [`Proposal`] — the verb it thinks was meant, the term it extracted, the cues
//! that fired, and the runner-up — for a person or a caller to accept. That
//! split is deliberate: a wrong parse that proposes costs a keystroke, a wrong
//! parse that executes costs a `copy` into the wrong file.
//!
//! ## What was measured, and what it refuted
//!
//! Two question sets, both scored as exact intent match against the nine verbs:
//!
//! | set | this parser | majority-intent null |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `SET` — 48 questions written alongside the cue table | **1.000** (48/48) | 0.146 (7/48) |
//! | `HELD_OUT` — 16 questions phrased to avoid the cue vocabulary, written after the table was frozen | **0.062** (1/16) | 0.125 (2/16) |
//!
//! **On unseen phrasing the parser loses to a null that ignores the words.**
//! Fifteen of the sixteen held-out questions fired no cue at all and fell
//! through to `Retrieve`. The 1.000 on `SET` measures nothing but the fact that
//! the same hand wrote the questions and the cues; it is a self-consistency
//! check and it is reported here only so that it cannot be quoted as a result.
//!
//! So the hypothesis *"a deterministic cue table is a sufficient NL front door
//! for the world layer"* is **refuted**, by its own benchmark, at a null it was
//! supposed to beat easily.
//!
//! ## What survives the refutation
//!
//! Not the cue table — the **contract around it**. [`Proposal`] is what any
//! parser in this slot has to produce: a named verb, an extracted term, the
//! evidence for the choice, the runner-up that was nearly picked, and a
//! `fallback` flag that is true exactly when nothing was understood. A model
//! put in this slot is held to the same shape, which is what keeps it a
//! replaceable interpreter instead of the memory. The measurement above is the
//! floor it has to clear, and clearing 0.062 on `HELD_OUT` is not an
//! achievement — it is the minimum entry condition.
//!
//! The cue table stays in the tree as that floor, and as the thing an
//! LLM-backed parser gets compared against on the same two sets. It is not
//! wired into any binary, because a 0.062 parser must not be in a user's path.
//!
//! ## Why there is no model in here
//!
//! An LLM would parse these better — that is now measured, not assumed. It
//! would also make the parse unauditable unless it is made to fill in
//! [`Proposal::evidence`]. The layer boundary this project keeps is that the
//! model stays **outside** as a replaceable interpreter, so the next step is a
//! `ModelProvider`-backed parser scored on these same sets, not a bigger cue
//! table. Growing the table to cover `HELD_OUT` would be fitting the test.
