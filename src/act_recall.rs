//! Does `act` actually find the contradiction it exists to surface?
//!
//! ## Why this module exists
//!
//! `act.rs` is the only implementation, in a twenty-one system survey, of
//! *acting while checking what is already believed* (`gaps.md` Gap 8). It
//! reaches that belief through one line — cosine over the command text against
//! claim statements — and that retrieval family scored **0–1/7 against a
//! whole-file ceiling of 5/7** in the 2×2 of 2026-09-13. So the differentiator
//! routes through the commodity, and the commodity was measured weak.
//!
//! Recorded as conceptual problem 1 in
//! `docs/plans/2026-09-13-four-conceptual-problems.md`, which asks for exactly
//! one thing: **measure `act`'s recall directly, against a construction-matched
//! null.** That is this module. Nothing here is an improvement to `act`; it is
//! the number that says whether an improvement is needed and, later, whether
//! one worked.
//!
//! ## The construction
//!
//! A seeded synthetic ledger of [`LEDGER_SIZE`] claims is built in one pass, so
//! every claim is the same age and age cannot be the thing that ranks. Eight of
//! them are `Contradicted` and each is the *one* claim a given command
//! contradicts; eight more are `Contradicted` and bear on nothing being run;
//! the rest are candidates and support. Ground truth is by construction — the
//! pairing is authored with the corpus, not judged afterwards.
//!
//! Two arms, because the failure mode is specific and an average over both
//! would hide it:
//!
//! | arm | the command | what it tests |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `lexical` | shares the claim's own words (`cargo build --release`) | the best case a string matcher can have |
//! | `paraphrase` | same act, no shared content words (`produce an optimised binary for shipping`) | the normal case — `act.rs`'s own stated limit |
//!
//! ## The nulls
//!
//! Two, both matched to the same `top` and drawn from the same one-age pool, so
//! the only difference between arm and null is the ranking:
//!
//! - **uniform** — surface `top` claims at random from the whole ledger. This
//!   is the null the plan names.
//! - **status** — surface `top` claims at random *from the contradicted claims
//!   only*. This is the harder and fairer one: `Bearing::is_warning` already
//!   knows a claim's status, so a system that ignored the command entirely and
//!   listed refuted claims would score this without doing any retrieval. Beating
//!   uniform and losing to status means the cosine leg contributes nothing that
//!   a status filter does not already give for free.
//!
//! A margin must clear one query's worth of recall (`1/queries`) to count, so a
//! single lucky pairing cannot produce a verdict.
//!
//! ## What it measured, 2026-09-13
//!
//! `recall@top` over 8 commands, ledger of 48, bge-base-en-v1.5 (`onnx-explicit`):
//!
//! | arm | top=1 | top=3 | top=5 | MRR@5 | null unif@5 | null status@5 |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `lexical` | 1.000 | 1.000 | **1.000** | 1.000 | 0.103 | 0.318 |
//! | `paraphrase` | 0.375 | 0.875 | **0.875** | 0.583 | 0.103 | 0.318 |
//!
//! Both arms clear both nulls at every `top`. **The pessimistic reading of the
//! 2×2 does not survive a direct measurement:** on a semantic embedder `act`
//! does find the contradicting claim, and on the list the CLI actually shows it
//! finds seven of eight even when the command shares no word with the claim.
//! What degrades is *rank*, not presence — MRR 1.000 → 0.583 — so on a
//! paraphrase the warning arrives mid-list rather than first, and at `top=1` the
//! paraphrase arm drops to 0.375.
//!
//! The same run on the random-projection fallback:
//!
//! | arm | recall@5 | MRR@5 | verdict |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `lexical` | 0.750 | 0.667 | HOLDS |
//! | `paraphrase` | **0.000** | 0.000 | FAILS |
//!
//! That is the sharper finding. Offline — the mode this crate advertises as
//! supported, not as a failure — `act` surfaces the contradiction **never** when
//! the command is phrased differently from the claim, and scores below both
//! nulls. Gap 8 is closed on a semantic embedder and open on the fallback, and
//! nothing in the CLI says which one is running when `act` prints nothing.
//!
//! ## The polarity arm, and the prediction recorded before it ran
//!
//! Every distractor above differs from its target by **topic**. None differs by
//! **polarity**, so the two arms measure the easy discrimination and say nothing
//! about the hard one: of two claims about this command, tell the refutation
//! from the endorsement. [`AFFIRMED_TWINS`] adds each target's endorsement to a
//! second ledger and asks which of the pair ranks first. The null is **0.500 by
//! construction** — no topic separates them.
//!
//! Measured elsewhere and the reason for this arm: dense retrievers rank
//! "treatment works" and "treatment does not work" alike (arXiv 2603.17580,
//! negation is syntactic, the embedding space is not), and in 95.2–99.8% of
//! structural-retrieval misses the false positive is more lexically similar to
//! the query than the gold item is (arXiv 2609.01556).
//!
//! **Predicted, before the arm was run** (recorded in commit d415488, so the
//! record is checkable): recall stays near 0.875 while discrimination lands
//! *below* 0.500 — the endorsement outranking the refutation in most pairs.
//!
//! ### What it did, and it is worse than the prediction
//!
//! bge-base-en-v1.5, 56-claim ledger, `discrim` = pairs where the refutation
//! outranked its endorsement, null 0.500:
//!
//! | arm | discrim | target@5 | twin@5 | reassured@5 | reassured@1 |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `lexical` | **0.250** | 8/8 | 8/8 | 0/8 | 5/8 |
//! | `paraphrase` | **0.125** | 6/8 | 8/8 | 2/8 | 3/8 |
//!
//! Not a coin flip — **inverted**. The endorsement outranks the refutation in
//! six of eight pairs on the lexical arm and seven of eight on the paraphrase
//! arm. The prediction was that polarity would be invisible; it is worse than
//! invisible, because the endorsement is systematically the *better* match for
//! a command that asks to do the thing.
//!
//! `reassured` is the cell that matters: the endorsement made the list and the
//! refutation did not. At `top 5` that is 0 and 2 of 8 — the operator still
//! sees both, so the list saves it. At `top 1` it is **5 of 8 and 3 of 8**: in
//! the majority of lexical pairs, `act --top 1` prints a Supported claim about
//! the exact thing a Contradicted claim refutes. That is not a miss. It is the
//! wrong answer delivered with the ledger's authority, and it is the strongest
//! argument in this crate for showing a list rather than a best match.
//!
//! ### And the two embedders fail in opposite directions
//!
//! The same arm on the random-projection fallback:
//!
//! | arm | discrim | verdict |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `lexical` | **0.750** | HOLDS |
//! | `paraphrase` | 0.125 | INVERTED |
//!
//! The lexical hash *beats* the semantic embedder on polarity, 0.750 against
//! 0.250, because it keys on the literal tokens — `fails`, `never`, `no` — that
//! the semantic space smooths away. That is arXiv 2603.17580's finding
//! reproduced from the other side: negation is syntactic, so the model that
//! cannot read meaning is the one that can still see the "not".
//!
//! Neither embedder dominates. The semantic one finds the right *topic* and
//! cannot tell the verdict; the hash can tell the verdict and cannot find the
//! topic (paraphrase recall 0.000). Read as an instruction, that is an argument
//! for a hybrid, and it is untested.
//!
//! **Do not over-read 0.750.** Eight pairs means one flip is worth 0.125, so
//! that margin is two pairs. The inversion on the semantic embedder is the
//! robust half of this result: it is the same sign on both arms, at every
//! `top`, and it is what the literature predicts.
//!
//! ## The selection sweep — the fix that does not pay
//!
//! The polarity result argues for reserving a slot for the best
//! warning-eligible claim ([`crate::act::Selection::WarningReserve`]). On the
//! benefit alone that looks free, and it is a tautology: the target *is* the
//! most relevant contradicted claim, so reserving a slot for it removes the
//! harm by construction. [`UNRELATED_COMMANDS`] is the cost arm — eight
//! commands nothing refutes, where every warning is a false alarm.
//!
//! Lexical arm, twin ledger, bge-base-en-v1.5:
//!
//! | top | policy | reassured | target@top | false alarms | removed/alarm |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | 1 | relevance | 5/8 | 2/8 | 0/8 | — |
//! | 1 | reserve@0.00–0.90 | 0/8 | 8/8 | **8/8** | 0.62 |
//! | 1 | reserve@0.95 | 0/8 | 8/8 | 5/8 | **1.00** |
//! | 1 | reserve@1.00 | 5/8 | 2/8 | 0/8 | — |
//! | 5 | relevance | 0/8 | 8/8 | **4/8** | — |
//! | 5 | reserve@0.95 | 0/8 | 8/8 | 5/8 | — |
//!
//! **The verdict is no.** At best the reserve removes one harm per false alarm
//! it creates, and below floor 0.95 it removes 0.62. At `top 5` — the default —
//! there is no harm left to remove, so the reserve is pure cost. `act` keeps
//! `Selection::Relevance` and the policy ships measured, off, and documented as
//! not worth turning on. The thing that actually fixes the polarity harm is the
//! default already being a list of five.
//!
//! `reserve@1.00` reproduces the relevance policy exactly, at both cuts. That is
//! the sweep's own control and it holds.
//!
//! ### What the cost arm found on the way
//!
//! Read the `top 5 · relevance` row again: **4 of 8** commands with nothing to
//! warn about already surface a warning today, with no reserve involved. `act`
//! has no relevance floor at all — it takes the top five by cosine and prints
//! whichever of them are refuted, however unrelated. On a ledger of any size
//! that is a warning on half of all unrelated commands, and it was never
//! measured because nothing asked what `act` does when the honest answer is
//! nothing. That is a separate defect from the polarity one, it is larger, and
//! it is not fixed here.
//!
//! ## The hybrid sweep, and the prediction recorded before it ran
//!
//! The polarity result says the two legs fail in opposite directions.
//! [`crate::act::Selection::Hybrid`] is the knob between them —
//! `alpha · cosine + (1 − alpha) · BM25`, both min-max normalised over the
//! candidates — and [`ALPHAS`] sweeps it with **both metrics on every row**, so
//! a weight that buys polarity by losing the topic cannot look like a win.
//! `alpha = 1.00` is cosine only and is the control: it must reproduce the
//! recorded 0.875 paraphrase recall and 0.125 paraphrase polarity.
//!
//! The sweep also includes `rrf@60` — [`crate::rag::fuse_rrf`] over the cosine
//! and BM25 orders. That hybrid has existed in `rag.rs` since G5 and **the
//! ledger has never called it**, which is itself an instance of the pattern the
//! capability sweep exists to catch: the crate shipped a hybrid retriever and
//! its sharpest consumer kept using the cosine leg alone.
//!
//! **Predicted, before the sweep ran** (recorded in the commit that added it):
//! there is an interior `alpha` that beats both endpoints on `combined`,
//! because the two legs fail on *different* pairs rather than on the same ones
//! with different severity.
//!
//! ### The prediction was wrong about the mechanism and right about the legs
//!
//! | policy | recall(para) | polarity(lex) | polarity(para) | combined |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `hybrid@0.00` (BM25 only) | 0.125 | 0.875 | 0.625 | 0.750 |
//! | `hybrid@0.50` | 0.625 | 0.375 | 0.125 | 0.750 |
//! | `hybrid@0.60`–`@1.00` | 0.875 | 0.250 | 0.125 | 1.000 |
//! | `rrf@60` | 0.625 | 0.375 | 0.125 | 0.750 |
//! | **`cascade@5`** | **0.875** | **0.875** | **0.625** | **1.500** |
//!
//! **No interior `alpha` exists.** From 0.60 to 1.00 the mixture is *identical*
//! to cosine alone — the lexical term is too small to reorder anything — and
//! below 0.60 topic recall collapses before polarity improves. The crate's own
//! `rrf@60` lands in the same dead zone. One score cannot do two jobs: at a
//! weight that keeps recall the lexical leg is inert, and at a weight that
//! reorders, recall is already gone.
//!
//! But the legs *are* complementary, which the endpoints show plainly: BM25
//! alone reads the verdict at 0.875/0.625 where cosine reads it at 0.250/0.125.
//! The mistake was mixing them into one score at all. Retrieval and ranking are
//! different problems — the entire axis of arXiv 2609.01556, whose finding is
//! items *retrieved but not ranked*.
//!
//! [`crate::act::Selection::CascadeRerank`] is the two-stage form: cosine
//! retrieves the pool, BM25 orders it. At `pool = top` it is a **pure
//! reordering** — recall@5 is set membership and therefore unchanged by
//! construction, not by achievement — and polarity goes 0.250 → 0.875 and
//! 0.125 → 0.625, both far above the 0.500 null. Past `pool = top` the second
//! stage can push the target out of the returned list and recall falls
//! (0.875 → 0.625 → 0.375 at pools 10 and 20) while polarity gains nothing, so
//! the pool wants to be exactly the cut.
//!
//! Through the same cost arm as the reserve: at `top 5` every cost column is
//! identical to the cosine policy, because a reordering cannot change which
//! claims are available. At `top 1` it removes 4 of the 5 reassurances for 2
//! false alarms — **2.00 harm removed per alarm, twice the best the reserve
//! managed** — and raises `target_in_top` from 2/8 to 7/8. The CLI now uses it;
//! `act::bearing_on` keeps the cosine order as the library's frozen baseline.
//!
//! ## The relevance floor — item B, and it is absolute, not relative
//!
//! The cost arm found that **4 of 8** commands with nothing to warn about get a
//! warning today. `act` has never had a floor: it takes the top five by cosine
//! and prints whichever are refuted, however unrelated.
//!
//! The first floor tried was leader-relative, the rule
//! [`crate::act::Selection::WarningReserve`] uses, and it did **nothing** at
//! 0.80, 0.90 or 0.95 — the leader is high for both classes of command, so the
//! ratio carries no signal. `examples/floor_spread` prints the number the sweep
//! could not, and the classes separate on the *absolute* score:
//!
//! | bge-base-en-v1.5 | best claim's cosine |
//! |---|---|
//! | command has a refutation | min **0.717**, median 0.798, max 0.913 |
//! | command has nothing to say | min 0.573, median 0.625, max **0.643** |
//!
//! Disjoint, 0.074 apart. Sweeping absolute floors through the same cost arm:
//!
//! | policy | reassured@1 | target@1 | alarms@1 | alarms@5 |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `relevance` (today) | 5/8 | 2/8 | 0/8 | 4/8 |
//! | `cascade@5` | 1/8 | 7/8 | 2/8 | 4/8 |
//! | **`cascade@5+floor0.66`** | **1/8** | **7/8** | **0/8** | **0/8** |
//! | `cascade@5+floor0.70` | 2/8 | 6/8 | 0/8 | 0/8 |
//! | `cascade@5+floor0.75` | 2/8 | 5/8 | 0/8 | 0/8 |
//!
//! 0.66 is strictly better than the current default on every column, at both
//! cuts, and the two floors above it start dropping real warnings — the window
//! is exactly the measured gap. The CLI uses 0.66.
//!
//! **The price is that the number is embedder-specific.** On the
//! random-projection fallback the same two distributions overlap completely
//! (0.705–0.902 against 0.609–0.824) and **no floor exists**. The CLI applies
//! none there rather than guessing one, so offline `act` keeps its false alarms
//! — which is the honest outcome and one more entry in the list of things the
//! hash cannot do.
//!
//! ## What this measures and what it does not
//!
//! It measures whether `bearing_on` puts the *one* contradicting claim in the
//! `top` the CLI actually shows (default 5). It does not measure whether an
//! operator then reads it, and it says nothing about real ledgers, whose claims
//! are neither uniformly aged nor authored to be findable. The corpus was authored
//! so that one claim is the right answer; a real ledger has near-misses, and
//! this number is therefore a ceiling on a real one, not an estimate of it.
//!
//! Run it: `physis-core act-recall [--top N] [--json]`. Artifacts land in
//! `benchmarks/results/act-recall.json`.
